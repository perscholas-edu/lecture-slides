### What does it Enable?
* Runs JavaScript in a computer process rather than in a Browser.
* Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.
* therefore, can be used to write server-side applications with access to
    * the operating system,
    * file system
    * everything required to build fully-functional applications

#### Running JavaScript in Computer Process
* Typically, the Browser is ran in a computer process. From the Browser, JavaScript can be executed.
* Node runs JavaScript directly in a computer process independent of the presence of a Browser.
    * Thus, Node can access the computer process directly.
    * Therefore, Node can access the computer's file system, and operating system.
* Node can be used to write server-side applications.
