# What is REST?
* REST stands for **RE**presentational**S**tate **T**ransfer and is an architectural
style for designing distributed network applications
* More precisely, **REST** is an architectural style consisting of a coordinated set
of architectural constraints applied to components, connectors, and data
elements, within a distributed hypermedia system.

#Client-Server

Concerns should be separated between clients and servers. This enables
client and server components to evolve independently and in turn allows the
system to scale.

-
-
#Stateless
The communication between client and server should be stateless. The
server need not remember the state of the client. Instead, clients must
include all of the necessary information in the request so that server can
understand and process it.

-
-
#Layered System
Multiple hierarchical layers such as gateways, firewalls, and proxies can exist
between client and server. Layers can be added, modified, reordered, or
removed transparently to improve scalability.

-
-
#Cache

Responses from the server must be declared as cacheable or noncacheable.
This would allow the client or its intermediary components to cache
responses and reuse them for later requests. This reduces the load on the
server and helps improve the performance.

-
-
#Uniform Interface
* All interactions between client, server, and intermediary components are
based on the uniformity of their interfaces.
* This simplifies the overall architecture as components can evolve
independently as long as they implement the agreed-on contract.

-
-

#Code on demand

Clients can extend their functionality by downloading and executing code on demand. Examples include JavaScript scripts, Java applets, Silverlight,and so on. This is an optional constraint.

-
-

#URI

Uniform Resource Identifier, or URI, for uniquely identifying resources.

-
-

#URI Templates
* Resource links can be dynamic

-
-

#Representation

**REST**ful resources are abstract entities, which represent a snap shot of data
at a point in time.

-
-

#HTTP Method (GET)

The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using
a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have
no other effect on the data.

-
-

#Idempotency

* An operation is considered to be idempotent if it produces the same server
state whether we apply it once or any number of times. 
* HTTP methods such
as GET, HEAD (which are also safe), PUT, and DELETE are considered to be
idempotent, guaranteeing that clients can repeat a request and expect the
same effect as making the request once.

-
-

#HTTP Methods (POST)
A **POST** request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer
information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

-
-

#HTTP Methods (HEAD)

Same as GET, but transfers the status line and header section only.

-
-

#HTTP Methods (PUT)

Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

-
-

#HTTP Methods (DELETE)

Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.

-
-

#HTTP Methods (CONNECT)

Establishes a tunnel to the server identified by a given URI.

-
-
#HTTP Methods (OPTIONS)

Describes the communication options for the target resource.

-
-

#HTTP Methods (TRACE)

Performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.

-
-

#CRUD
* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

-
-

# HTTP Status Codes
* 1xx Informational (100 Continue)
* 2xx Success (200 OK)
* 3xx Redirection (300 Multiple Choices)
* 4xx Client Error (400 Bad Request)
* 5xx Server Error (500 Internal Server Error)

-
-

# HTTP Status Codes
#(1xx Informational)

-

# 100 Continue
This means that the server has received the request headers, and that the client should
proceed to send the request body (in the case of a request for which a body needs to be
sent; for example, a POST request).

-

# 101 Switching Protocols
This means the requester has asked the server to switch protocols and the server is
acknowledging that it will do so

-

# 102 Processing
As a WebDAV request may contain many sub-requests involving file operations, it may
take a long time to complete the request. This code indicates that the server has
received and is processing the request, but no response is available yet

-
-

# HTTP Status Codes
# (2xx Success)

-

# 200 OK
Standard response for successful HTTP requests.

-

# 201 CREATED

The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being
created.

-

# 202 Accepted
The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not
been completed. The request might or might not eventually be acted
upon, as it might be disallowed when processing actually takes place.

-
-

# HTTP Status Codes
#(3xx Redirection)

-
# 300 Multiple Choices

Indicates multiple options for the resource that the client may follow.

-

#3o1 Moved Permanently
This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI

-

# 308 Permanent Redirect
The request, and all future requests should be repeated using another URI.

-
-

#HTTP Status Codes
#(4xx Client Error)

-

#400 Bad Request
The server cannot or will not process the request due to something
that is perceived to be a client error

-

#401 Unauthorized
Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication
is required and has failed or has not yet been provided.

-

#404 Not Found
The requested resource could not be found but may be available
again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible

-
-

#WEB Socket

A protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP
connection.

-
-

#Servlet

A **servlet** is a small Java program that runs within a Web server.

**Servlets** receive and respond to requests from Web clients, usually across
HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol.

-
-

#AOP

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented
Programming (OOP) by providing another way of thinking about program
structure. The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas inAOPthe
unit of modularity is the aspect.

-
-

#ORM
Object-relational mapping (ORM) is a technique (a.k.a. design pattern) of
accessing a relational database from an object-oriented language (Java, for
example)

-
-

#JMS

**JMS** is a part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, and is defined by a
specification developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 914. It is
a messaging standard that allows application components based on the
Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) to create, send, receive, and read
messages.

-
-

#Transaction
In computer programming, a transaction usually means a sequence of
information exchange and related work (such as database updating) that is
treated as a unit for the purposes of satisfying a request and for ensuring
database integrity.

-
-

#BEAN
A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed
by a Spring IoC container. These beans are created with the configuration
metadata that you supply to the container

-
-

#IOC

In software engineering, inversion of control (IoC) describes a design in
which custom-written portions of a computer programreceive the flow of
control from a generic, reusable library.

#Dependency Injection (DI)

**Dependency Injection** design pattern allows us to remove the hard-coded
dependencies and make our application loosely coupled, extendable and
maintainable.
