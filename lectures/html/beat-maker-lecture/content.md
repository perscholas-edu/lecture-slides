## The Anatomy of HTML

### Angle Brackets
* (the greater than & less than symbols “<” & “>”) The  “<>” tells the web browser that “this is an html tag.”

-
### Names

## What is CSS and why do we use it?
* CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. They are stored in external CSS files
* CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
* CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
    * page layouts, colors, and fonts

-
### How Does CSS Work

```Html
<p class="quickPink"> this is my paragraph </p>
```

* Above is an example of a simple html paragraph

```css
quickPink { color: pink; font-weight: bold; };
```

* Above is a css example, quickPink is the "selector" -   the part of css code specifying which html elements the css styling will effect

### Example

<p class="quickPink">this is my paragraph</p>
