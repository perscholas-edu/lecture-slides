2. What is HTML?
3. What is a programming langauge?

### What is the Internet?
* Set of _interconnected devices_
* enforces standard _communication protocols_

-
#### Set of interconnected computers
* Internet is the product of _**client-server relationships**_
* Client is a requester of information.
* Server is a sender of information.
* This very simple dynamic is the innerworkings of the entire internet.

-
#### Client (Information Requester)
* To view a webpage, a client must first send a request to a _server_.
* Requests are sent in the form of an _HTTP_ message requesting access to view an _HTML document_.
* _Browser_ is the typical _client interface_
    * (i.e. - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer)


-
#### Server (Information Sender)
* Provider, servicer, or most commonly a _server_ of information.
* Servers await communications from client.
    * This waiting for a request is called _listening_.
* Requests are responded to in the form of _HTTP_ messages and subsequently a viewable _HTML document_ or _webpage_.

### What is HTML
* What are manuscript mark ups?
* What is hyper text mark up?
* What is cascading styling?


-
#### Manuscript Mark Ups
* Manuscript mark-ups use symbols which _encapsulate_ a section of a document to annotate how the section should be structured.
  * (i.e. - revision instructions by editors before any final print)
* Often enforced structure on an encapsulated **section** of the document.

-
#### Cascading Mark Up Structure
* Manuscript mark-ups often used the same symbol in different colors to denote more specific ways of structuring the same group-type.
    * These colors had a _cascading_ effect on the _mark up tags_ in the manuscripts.
        * <font color="blue">¶</font> - Create new paragraph, indent once
        * <font color="red">¶</font> - Create new paragraph, indent twice




-
#### Hyper Text Mark Up Instructions
* Inspired by the _marking up_ of paper manuscripts
* Standard _mark up_ language used to display documents in a web browser.
* Each of these marked up documents are called _HTML documents_, and they form _web pages_ when being _hosted_ by a _server_.
* Sections of a document are denoted by encapsulating sections of text in _tags_.
    * _tags_ denote the beginning and ending of a section on a document.

-
### What is programming?
* a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a device to perform specific tasks.
* is used to implement _algorithms_


-
#### What is grammar and syntax?
* structure of a language or sentence
    * governs the composition of
        * clauses
        * phrases
        * words
* Rules and examples show how the language should be used


-
#### What are _algorithms_?
* set of instructions used to solve an entire class of problems
* allows processing of dynamic input resulting in dynamic output

-
### What is JavaScript
* programming language for the browser
* enables dynamic web pages
* creates responsive elements
* Sending HTTP messages to a server  




-
#### Dynamic Web pages
* Allows on-the-fly changes of a webpage's view.
* Can display different content each time it is interacted with
* To _interact_ with a webpage could mean:
    * scrolling
    * clicking
    * keystroking



-
#### Responsive Elements
* Message boxes which prompt for some input
* Boxes or other _page-elements_ which enlarge upon clicking
* Prepopulated text fields
* animations


-
#### Sending HTTP Messages to a Server
* Enables every potential interaction with a _server-side dyanmic webpage_.
    * Put data onto server
    * Get data from server
    * Modify data on server
    * Remove data from server
