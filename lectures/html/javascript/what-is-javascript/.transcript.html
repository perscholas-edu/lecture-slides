<h2> Slide 1 </h2>
<br>What is javascript?
<br>Well, to answer that, let's first begin by answering these questions first:
<ul>
    <li>What is _the internet_?</li>
    <li>What is _HTML?</li>
    <li>What is _programming_?</li>
</ul>







<h2>Slide 3</h2>
So, what is the internet?
<br>It's a set of interconnected devices.
<br>It enforces standard communication protocols

<br>A set of interconnected devices means they are a machine which can communicate to another machine external to itself.
<br>A standard communication protocol means it has a common language that it uses to speak to other devices.
<br>That language is called HTTP

<br>Much like you and I have to have a standard langauge to speak in, machines must also have a standard langauge to speak in.
<br>If I were to speak to you in a language that was foreign to you, then we would not be able to send and receive information to each other. 



<h2>Slide 4</h2>
<br>Now, when we say that it is a set of interconnected computers, we imply that there are two relationships; two entities.


<div class="blooper">
    <br>sender and receiver
    <br>the sender of hte information is the server
    <br>the receiver is the 
    <br>uhh, let's ixnay on that
</div>

<br>The client is a _requester_ of information
<br>And the server is a _sender_ of information
<br>This very simple dynamic is the innerworkings of the entire internet.





<div id="internet-surfer">
    <br>So, for client, the information requester,
    <br>The client receives webpages as they _surf_ through the internet.
    <div class="animation">
        <br>guy surfing on beach observing the sea local to him
        <br>surfs to other beaches (far distance) by means of <i>request</i> to direct him
    </div>
</div>





<div id="internet-surfer-request">
    <br>When they do that, they are sending a message to the server.
    <br>That message is what we call a request
    <div class="animation">
        replay guy traveling to other beaches (far away) by means of <i>request</i> to direct him
    </div>
</div>




<h1> Slide 3/1 </h1>
It is the product of client-server relationships
A client is a requester of information.
    Typically, we think of the client as the _surfer_ or _browser_ of the internet.
A server is a sender of information.
    Typically we think of the server as the sender of information.
This dynamic is the innerworkings of the entire internet.







<h1> Slide 3/2 </h1>
To view a webpage, a client must first send a request to a server.
    This means any time you click a link, you are actually sending a message to a server asking to view an HTML document.
    The message you are sending is called a request.
        And the reason we call it such, is because there is no guarantee that you will be given the information being requested.
    These requests are sent to the server in a language called HTTP.
        HTTP is specifically designed to tell web servers and browsers what action to take in response to various commands.






<h1> Slide 3/3 </h1>
The server can be thought of as the provider, servicer, or most acceptably, server of information
The server awaits requests from a client.
    We call this waiting process "listening".
Requests are responded to in the form of HTTP messages and subsequently a viewable HTML document, also known as a "webpage".




















<h1> Slide 4</h1>
What is HTML?
HTML is the standard _mark up_ language used to display documents in a web browser.
It was inspired by the _marking up_ of paper manuscripts.
    For example, the revision instructions by editors before a final print were done by _marking up_ a draft.
Each of these marked up documents are called _HTML Documents_.
    They are considered web pages when they are being hosted on a server which makes them accessible via the web.
