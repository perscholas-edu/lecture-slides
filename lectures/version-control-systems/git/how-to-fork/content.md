# How to Fork and Clone

-
* Click the `Fork` button located at the top right of the project you would like to _fork_.
* Navigate to your github profile to find the _newly forked repository_.
* Clone the repository from **your account** into the `~/dev` directory.
    * if you do not have a `~/dev` directory, make one by executing the following command:
        * `mkdir ~/dev`
* Open the newly cloned project in a code editor (Visual Studio Code, for example).
